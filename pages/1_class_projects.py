        __TrueTide__ is designed for _international students_ navigating new environments and cultures. 
        Adjusting to life in a new country can be overwhelming, and students often struggle to find accurate, culturally relevant information. 
        __TrueTide__ helps bridge that gap by providing a diverse range of perspectives on everything from national policies to local slang and customs.

        The app's key feature is its ___DualView___, which allows users to see opposing viewpoints on controversial topics, fostering critical thinking. 
        To support responsible information-sharing, TrueTide offers easy-to-use __fact-checking__ tools and recommends relevant _Citations_ to users as they post content,
        making it simple to back up information. TrueTide offers a trusted and culturally aware platform, easing the transition for students as they learn more about their new surroundings.

        __Craftfolio__ is a web app designed for beginner crafters looking to confidently _start_ and _complete_ creative fiber projects. 
        Our app targets a unique, underserved audience of new crafters who often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of project planning and lack of accessible resources. 
        __Craftfolio__ empowers users by providing an intuitive project tracker and resource management tools tailored specifically to beginners working with different fibers. 
        Unlike existing crafting communities that focus mainly on showcasing finished projects, __Craftfolio__ offers a _collaborative_ space for planning, sharing, and discussing project materials.

        Key features include personalized _project filters_ based on _available_ sources, _ratings_ to simplify finding useful guides, 
        and _sepcial comments_ fostering a supportive and interactive environment. 
        Craftfolio's value lies in bridging the gap between inspiration and execution, helping users efficiently manage crafting resources and build confidence through shared expertise.
